Comment: When I took over the package in 2014 the d/copyright file was
 written in free format and didn't mention debian/* files, but d/rules
 had this section:
  # (c) 2001 Brian Russo, under GPL.
  # (c) 2003 Josselin Mouette
  # (c) 2007-2009 Francesco P. Lovergine.
  # (c) 2010-2013 Sylvestre Ledru
 Because the GPL is mentioned with no version I infered GPL-2+.
